Dinner and Code is an opportunity for you to learn to code in a beginner-friendly environment.
Eat good food, work on a project (or bring your own), find a mentor or be a mentor, and network with leading
programming experts, recruiters, and entrepreneurs in San Antonio, Texas.

### The meetup

We'll spend about six hours together. We'll have a speaker, eat some food, and then spend time networking and working
on software projects. You can bring something you're already working on or start one of the easy projects we provide
materials on.
